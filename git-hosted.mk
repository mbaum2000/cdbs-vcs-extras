# sets up a get-orig-source target for downloading and creating a source
# tarball from a hosted git service.  Note that this MUST come before
# tarball.mk if that is being used (despite the warning in tarball.mk
# that it must come first in the list of included rules).  Also, as a
# convenience, this rule will set the DEB_TARBALL and DEB_TAR_SRCDIR
# variables for use in tarball.mk.
