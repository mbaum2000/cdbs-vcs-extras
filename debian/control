Description: CDBS VCS Extras are a set of makefile-based rule files
 to be used in conjunction with the Common Debian Build System (CDBS) to
 make debian/rules files.  The rules provided here are primarily
 intended to aid in the creation of source tarballs generated from an
 upstream Version Control System (VCS) using the get-orig-source target.
