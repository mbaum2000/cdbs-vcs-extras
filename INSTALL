To Build
--------

This project is made up entirely of makefile includes, and has no code
to be compiled.  Running `make` or `make build` amounts to a no-op.  To
make use of the software, see the installation section below.

Dependencies
------------

CDBS version 0.4.89 or greater is required.  On Debian and Ubuntu systems,
it can be installed by running:

sudo apt-get install cdbs

Installation
------------

To install this project from source, run `make install` (as root, unless
a prefix is specified).  The default install directory is the standard
cdbs directory, located at /usr/share/cdbs/1.  An install prefix can be
specified by invoking:

make install DESTDIR=<prefix>

which will install the files to `<prefix>/usr/share/cdbs/1`.
Alternately, a custom install directory can be specified by invoking:

make install CDBS1_DIR=<install_dir>

If an alternate directory is specified, the debian/rules file that
contains any rules defined by this project need to include the lines:

_cdbs_vcs_rules_path ?= <install_dir>/rules
_cdbs_vcs_class_path ?= <install_dir>/class

before any of the rules are included.
