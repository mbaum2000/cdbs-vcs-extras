# sets up a get-orig-source target for downloading a source tarball from
# bitbucket.  Note that this MUST come before  tarball.mk if that is
# being used (despite the warning in tarball.mk that it must come first
# in the list of included rules).  Also, as a convenience, this rule
# will set the DEB_TARBALL and DEB_TAR_SRCDIR variables for use in
# tarball.mk.
